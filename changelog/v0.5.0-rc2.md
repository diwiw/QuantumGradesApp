## v0.5.0-rc2 — CI/CD stabilized (Windows + optional docs)

### Fixes
- **logger:** Added `Platform.hpp` to neutralize Windows `ERROR` macro collision.
- **cmake:** Made Doxygen optional with `BUILD_DOCS` flag (OFF by default).
- **ci/release:** Set `BUILD_TYPE` via job-level env to fix `--config` issue on Windows.

### CI/CD
- Verified green builds on Ubuntu and Windows.
- Updated workflows to produce consistent artifacts across OS.

### Notes
- This release candidate validates the pipeline correctness before v0.5.0 stable.
