# v0.7.1 – Modularization, Testing, and Documentation Foundation

### 🚀 Added
- Full **modular CMake structure** (`core`, `utils`, `domain`, `io`, `strategy`, `persistence`, `reporting`)
- **Asynchronous logging system** (`ILogger`, `SpdLogger`, `LoggerFactory`) with DI-based initialization
- **DataExporter** for exporting `BarSeries` to CSV, with extensive unit tests
- **Doxygen documentation**: architecture diagrams, backtest flow, and class relationships (SVG)
- Automatic **`Version.hpp`** generation from Git tags and build timestamps
- Updated **VSCode tasks and presets** for one-click builds, tests, and documentation
- Enhanced CI compatibility with **Ninja + vcpkg + MSVC** on both Linux and Windows

### 🔧 Changed
- All demos (`grades_demo`, `logger_demo`, `backtest_demo`) now use the new production async logger
- Unified namespaces (`qga::core`, `qga::utils`, `qga::domain`, etc.)
- Modularized CMake — separated per-component builds and public includes
- Reorganized include structure: headers now live under `include/core`, `include/utils`, etc.
- Clean and consistent configuration via `Config` class (centralized entry point)
- Improved documentation build flow and separation of examples from main build

### 🧹 Cleaned
- Removed legacy synchronous logger (`utils/Logger`)
- Removed obsolete files (`include/Version.h`, outdated test variants)
- Simplified `CMakeLists.txt` across project structure
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude `app.log`, build artifacts, generated `Version.hpp`, and docs outputs
- Removed `.mmd` diagram files (retained `.svg` for unified documentation)

### 🧪 Fixed
- Build and link issues after modularization
- Missing include paths for tests and demos
- IntelliSense inconsistencies (`compile_commands.json`)
- Doxygen warnings related to undefined symbols and image references
- Corrected target linking for examples (`BUILD_LEGACY_DEMOS` and per-example flags)

### 🧭 Notes
- This release completes the transition to a fully modular and maintainable architecture.
- All core modules (`core`, `domain`, `utils`, `io`, `persistence`) are now independent, testable units.
- Documentation and architecture diagrams are now synchronized between Doxygen and README.
- Demos use production-level async loggers and can serve as integration tests.

# 🔮 v0.8.0 – Parallel Backtesting, Reporting, and Persistence

### 🚧 In Progress (Milestone [0.8.0 on GitHub](https://github.com/diwiw/QuantGradesApp/milestone/3))

#### 🧵 Multithreading & Concurrency
- Parallelized **Backtest Engine** (thread-safe queue, worker pool, and producer–consumer model)
- Thread-aware **LoggerFactory** (asynchronous queue-based sink)
- Unit tests with **ThreadSanitizer** and **TSAN CI integration**

#### 🧾 Reporting System
- Implementation of **ReporterManager** (Observer Pattern)
- Real-time and post-run reporting (CSV, JSON, console, async sinks)
- Extensible reporter interfaces for statistics and PnL summaries

#### 🧩 Persistence Layer
- Connection pooling for **SQLite3**
- Async persistence workers for historical and session data
- Transaction-safe data writing with rollback support

#### ⚙️ Performance and Testing
- Benchmarks and profiling via CMake + Google Benchmark
- TSAN/ASAN integration for CI
- Expanded Doctest coverage (multithreaded, persistence, reporting)
- Continuous build validation for Linux and Windows

#### 🧠 Documentation & Tooling
- New **developer guide** (`docs/dev_guide.md`)
- High-level architecture overview in Doxygen (with data flow and sequence diagrams)
- Improved README badges (build, docs, tests)
- Reorganization of CI workflow (`linux-build.yml`, `windows-build.yml`)

## 📜 Release Summary

**v0.7.1** lays the foundation for a production-ready, modular C++ architecture with asynchronous logging, CI integration, and detailed documentation.
The upcoming **v0.8.0** focuses on **parallel execution**, **data persistence**, and **real-time reporting**, preparing the framework for **HPC and quantum simulation extensions**.

## Config Singleton Behavior in Tests (temporary note – removed in v1.0.0)

Due to the global and persistent nature of the Config singleton, running multiple
test cases in a single binary may carry state between tests.

As a temporary solution for v0.7.1, every test suite performs an explicit
`cfg.loadDefaults()` call before loading JSON fixtures.

A full redesign of the test harness (including dependency injection,
singleton isolation, and logger mocking) is planned for milestone v1.0.0.
