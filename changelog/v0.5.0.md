# v0.5.0 — CI/CD foundation (Build + Release workflows)

## Added
- GitHub Actions **Build** workflow: configure → build → run unit tests on Ubuntu and Windows, with uploaded build/test artifacts.
- GitHub Actions **Release-on-tag** workflow: builds on tag `v*` and publishes artifacts to GitHub Releases.

## Changed
- CMake: small adjustments for CI compatibility (generator/--config usage, cleaner logs).

## Notes
- This lays the groundwork for automated releases; future versions will add badges, caching improvements, and more platforms.
